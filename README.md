Project Title : My Hero Academia (Anime Topics)

My First Project : Html & Css & Responsiv

The goal was to reproduce a model, respecting the specifications (Font-family, Color, Position of the <Tags> ...). It took me almost 2 weeks to made this (Yes, i know...). First week, i've finished, but the responsiv design was very poor. So i have to start over a new one. This allowed me to better restructure my page, and how to proceed step by step. It was a complicated time, but I ended up making the model as requested (Have to correct some little details...).

It was made : On my first development course online.
